Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. <br>The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas;[11][12] one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world;[13] and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.</p>
